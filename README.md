# book-recommendation
## Objective:
Deciding which book to read leaves us wasting a lot of our precious time. Most of the times we are also not satisfied with our pick and we get disappointed.
To get over that disappointment phase I thought about creating a place where we can look for the right kind of book we are looking for if not the average then the top books of the top authors. Ranging from Mystery to Fiction to Adventure I have listed all top books of the particular genre so we can spend our times on other important stuffs.

## Technologies used:
HTML
CSS
PHP

## Future plans:
1. Add introduction about the books.
2. Add more genre of books.
3. Link the books to purchasing sites.
4. Usage of Javascript to make it a full fledged website.
5. Add cover photo of the books.
6. Monetize it.
